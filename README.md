## L3 Project : comparison of hashFunctions

This project takes place in the frame of the second semester of my L3 at UPMC.
The goal is to chose and compare some hash functions (non cryptographic), on their homogeinity of keys distribution.
Several sets of keys will be studied, in order to select best function for given set (english/french text, code...)

The codes for the project should be written in OCaml.

For more details on the project, please read the pdf file in the summary folder (in French).
